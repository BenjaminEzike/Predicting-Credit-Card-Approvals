# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

A logistic regression from the sklearn package is build based on an available database to predict the approval or decline or a credit card application, as part of a process for automating the applicaiton process in a commercial bank. The following steps are followed in this project.

- Data inspection
- Filling missing values with the mean of each variable
- spliting the data into train and test set (33%)
- Hot encoding the categorical variables in the dataframe
- Scaling the data
- Fitting a logistic regression model to the training set
- Making a prediction and getting the confusion matrix, accuacy is 100% is achieved. 
- An effort is made to improve the model, by performing a gridsearch to find best hyper-parameters.
